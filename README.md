# Startup-Funding-Analysis-in-India
This project is based on the dataset which has funding information of the Indian startups from January 2015 to August 2017. It includes columns with the date funded, the city the startup is based out of, the names of the funders, and the amount invested (in USD).

This analysis could be used to further dwelve into useful insights using Funding variations based upon the oil price changes, government changes and other variable like demonitization, etc.
